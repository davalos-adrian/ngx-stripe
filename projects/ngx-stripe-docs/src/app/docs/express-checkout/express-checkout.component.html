      The <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js/elements_object/express_checkout_element_click_event">click event</ngstr-link>
      is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the customer clicks a payment button.
      Use this event to configure the payment interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must call the resolve function with all the status info to display the payment interface. Refer to
      the official docs for more details.

      Notice the event name is <strong>clicked</strong>, not click that could cause a conflict with the native click event.

    <p>
      The <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js/elements_object/express_checkout_element_confirm_event">confirm event</ngstr-link>

      The <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js/elements_object/express_checkout_element_cancel_event">cancel event</ngstr-link>
      is triggered from an Express Checkout Element when the payment interface is dismissed.
    </p>
    <ngstr-panel type="warning">
      Note that in some browsers, the payment interface might be dismissed by the customer even after they authorize the payment.
      This means that you might receive a cancel event after receiving a confirm event.
      If you're using the cancel event as a hook for canceling the customer's order, make sure you also refund the payment that you just created.
