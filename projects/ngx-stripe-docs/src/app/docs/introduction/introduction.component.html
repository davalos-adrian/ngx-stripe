      Ngx Stripe is a thin wrapper around
      <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js">Stripe Elements</ngstr-link>. It allows adding Elements to any
      <strong>Angular</strong> app.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js">Stripe.js reference</ngstr-link>
      covers complete <strong>Elements</strong> customization details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use Elements with any Stripe product to collect online payments. To find the right integration path for
      your business, explore

    <p>The library provides three major elements:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>Lazy script loading</li>
      <li>Element Components</li>
      <li>Stripe Observable wrapper</li>
    </ul>

      This project has not been updated for a while. After reviewing the state of the art for React and Vue
      counterparts, some major changes are going to be introduced to align this project with
      <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js"> Stripe Elements </ngstr-link>.
    </p>
    <ol role="list">
      <li>
        ngx-stripe will no longer maintain its own interfaces. Instead, &#64;stripe/stripe-js has been added as peer
        dependency. This will make the library easier to maintain and avoid mistakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js">Stripe Service</ngstr-link>
        has been updated with all the missing APIs from StripeJS.
      </li>
      <li>
        All the missing
        <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react#element-components">Element Components</ngstr-link>
        like IBAN, Ideal, FPX, ... have been added.
      </li>
      <li>Request Payment Button now has full support.</li>
      <li>
        Added
        <ngstr-link url="https://stripe.com/docs/js/element/the_element_container">Container Style</ngstr-link>
        functionality support.
      </li>
      <li>
        A
        <ngstr-link url="https://github.com/richnologies/ngx-stripe/blob/main/MIGRATION.md">Migration</ngstr-link>
        guide has been added with details of what have changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The new version of library is compatible from Angular 6+ major versions. Check the
        <ngstr-highlight>Installation</ngstr-highlight> section see how to install an older version.
      </li>
      <li>All documentation has been moved to this new site.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Finally, in order to ease the transition, we are naming the old version of the library
      <ngstr-highlight>legacy</ngstr-highlight> and we have created some npm tags to make it easy to install older
      versions. Check <ngstr-highlight>Installation</ngstr-highlight> to say a complete list of available versions.
